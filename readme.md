## About

I made this little project to train mainly my JavaScript skills. It's made with pure JavaScript, HTML and a bit of Bootstrap, just to make it look a little nicer. I think the cool thing about this project is that **the algorithm is generic enough to handle a board of any size.** Feel free to use the *create_board()* function. Have a good time.
